Hermes
======

This program is to trick my fridge/freezer into thinking its a different
temperature to what it actually is. This allows me to use my fridge/freezer for
as a keezer/fermentation chamber  without having to pull out the existing
temperature controller. 

It sounded like a good idea in my head.

The Roman name for Hermes was Mercury.
Hermes was a trickster.
